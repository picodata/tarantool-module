# Change Log

# [?.?.?] Unreleased

### Added
- `AuthMethod::DEFAULT` represents the default value of `AuthMethod`, but is available in constant contexts.

### Changed
- MSRV is now 1.81 instead of 1.71.1 as it was.

### Fixed
- `network::protocol::codec::Header::encode` will not truncate to `u8` an
  `network::protocol::codec::IProtoType` integer from an outside stream at decoding.

### Deprecated

### Breaking changes
- Use `extern "C-unwind"` instead of `extern "C"` for lua ffi functions, which
  seems to help with lua_error!() in release builds on recent versions of rust.

### Added (picodata)

### Changed (picodata)

### Fixed (picodata)

### Breaking changes (picodata)
- `AuthMethod::default()` is now `Md5`, not `ChapSha1`.

### Deprecated (picodata)

- `Tuple::as_named_buffer` is now deprecated without any alternative, same as `TupleFormat::{names, name_count}`.


# [6.1.0] Dec 10 2024

### Added
- `network::client::tcp::TcpStream` not supports async connection, provided with `connect_async` and `connect_timeout_async` methods
- `impl Default for log::TarantoolLogger`

### Changed
- `error::Result` type alias now has another generic parameter E, which defaults
  to `tarantool::error::Error`, but allows this type alias to be used as a drop
  in replacement from `std::result::Result`.

### Fixed
- `network::client::tcp::TcpStream` does not close underlying fd anymore. Now fd will be closed only when the last copy of tcp stream is dropped.

### Deprecated
- `network::client::tcp::UnsafeSendSyncTcpStream` is now deprected. `network::client::tcp::TcpStream` should be used instead.


# [6.0.0] Nov 20 2024

### Added
- `tlua::Push` trait implementations for `OsString`, `OsStr`, `Path`, `PathBuf`
- `tlua::LuaRead` trait implementations for `OsString`, `PathBuf`
- tlua::LuaTable::metatable which is a better alternative to the existing `tlua::LuaTable::get_or_create_metatable`
- `ffi::tarantool::box_schema_version` and `ffi::tarantool::box_session_id` functions
- `network::protocol::SyncIndex::get` method
- `network::protocol::codec::{LegacyCall, Nop, Prepare, Begin, Commit, Rollback}` variants
- `network::protocol::codec::Header::encode_from_parts` function
- `network::protocol::codec::Header::{encode, decode}` functions
- `network::protocol::codec::iproto_key::SQL_INFO` constant
- Added optional field `connect_timeout` to `network::protocol::Config`.
Used in `network::client::Client::connect_with_config` for
restricting time connection establishment.
- Untagged enum represention as in serde with `#[encode(untagged)]` attribute
- `tlua::Nil` now supports (de)serialization via serde

### Changed
- `network::protocol::codec::IProtoType` uses C language representation
- `cbus::sync::std::ThreadWaker` now uses internal thread FIFO queue when blocking threads on send.
- `#[tarantool::proc]` attribute doesn't add procs to a global array unless
  `stored_procs_slice` feature is enabled.
- `proc::all_procs` will now panic if `stored_procs_slice` feature is disabled.

### Fixed
- `tlua::{Push, PushInto, LuaRead}` now work for HashSet & HashMap with custom hashers.
- Use after free in `fiber::Builder::start_non_joinable` when the fiber exits without yielding.
- Incorrect, off-spec MP Ext type: caused runtime errors on some platforms.
- Panic in coio test starting from 1.80 Rust.
- Impossible to use procedural macros(like `tarantool::proc`, `tarantool::test`) through reexporting tarantool.

### Deprecated
- tlua::LuaTable::get_or_create_metatable is deprecated now in favor of tlua::LuaTable::metatable.

### Breaking changes
- Use `extern "C-unwind"` instead of `extern "C"` for all trampolines which take `*mut ffi::lua_State`
  (checked with `rg 'extern "C".*lua_State'`). `tlua::error!` throws an exception to unwind the stack,
  hence we need to use a proper ABI to fix UB in picodata.

### Breaking changes (picodata)
- Add session ID to the argument list of the `sql_prepare_ext`.
- Replace `sql_unprepare` with `sql_unprepare_ext` (contains an additional session ID argument).



# [5.0.0] Aug 06 2024

### Added

- `say_info`, `say_verbose`, `say_debug`, `say_warn`, `say_crit`, `say_error`,
  `say_fatal`, `say_sys_error` macros for basic logging into the tarantool's
  default logger. Use these when you need to log messages, but don't have any
  facilities set up for this, e.g. internally in tarantool-module code.
- `log::{current_level, set_current_level}` for setting/getting current log
  level of the default logger without going through lua.
- `error::Error::ConnectionClosed` variant which can happen when converting from
  errors returned from `network::client`.
- `tlua::as_table` macro for more straight-forward creation of lua tables
  compared to naked `tlua::AsTable`.
- `fiber::NoYieldsGuard` helper struct for scope-level guarding against yields.
  Can be used to assert that a function or it's portion must not yield.
- `fiber::NoYieldsRefCell` a RefCell replacement for fiber-safety. Will cause a
  panic if a value is borrowed across yields. Also displays the source location
  of the last borrow unlike the standard RefCell.
- `Tuple::to_vec` method to get raw msgpack bytes from `Tuple`.
- `BoxError::{file, line, errno, cause, fields}` methods for getting the
  corresponding info from the tarantool error (currently only work for remote errors).
- `BoxError::{new, with_location}` constructors useful for returning structured
  error info from stored procedures.
- `BoxError::set_last` method for setting the info about the last error in the
  current fiber. Useful for returning structured error info from stored procedures.
- `error::set_last_error` function. It's similar to `tarantool::set_error!` macro,
  but the new function also supports specifying an explicit source location, while
  the old macro always uses the caller's location.
- `error::IntoBoxError` trait. Implement this for your error types to return
  structured error info from stored procedures defined with `#[tarantool::proc]`,
  or just use `BoxError` directly.
- `network::client::tcp::TcpStream::connect_timeout` method.
- Now `test` attribute supports adding a compile time conditional expression for
  the `should_panic` argument, i.e. `#[tarantool::test(should_panic = cfg!(debug_assertions))]`
- `anyhow` feature that adds `IntoBoxError` impl for `anyhow::Error` so `anyhow::Result` could be
  returned from the stored proc.
- `tarantool::time::INFINITY` reexport from `tarantool::clock::INFINITY` for
  convenience.
- `tarantool::time::Instant::{now_fiber, now_accurate}` methods with more
  descriptive names then before. Use `now_fiber` when computing timeouts, use
  `now_accurate` when benchmarking.
- `#[encode(as_raw)]` on struct fields and enum variants
  with `Vec<u8>` type, representing raw MessagePack.
- added `Decimal::into_raw` functions
- added `Tuple::as_ptr` functions
- Custom Encode/Decode allows skipping `Option` fields
- added support for zero-copy string decoding
  via `tarantool::msgpack::encode::Decode` trait as `&str`.
- `serde_bytes::Deserialize` implementation for `Tuple`.
- `TupleFormat::as_ptr` method.

### Changed

- `tarantool::error::TarantoolError` is renamed `BoxError`. The old name is
  still available via a type alias, and is not yet deprecated so as not to break
  too much code, but in future it will be deprecated.
- `network::client::{Client, ReconnClient}::send` now returns one of the new
  error variants: `ConnectionClosed`, `RequestEncode`, `ResponseDecode` or
  `ErrorResponse`.
- `tarantool::error::Error::Remote` variant is no longer disabled without the
  `net_box` feature.
- `tarantool::set_error!` macro will now use the caller's location, so if it's
  called from a function marked `#[track_caller]`, the log message will contain
  that function's call site, instead of the location of the macro call itself.
- `Decimal` type is now backed by builtin tarantool decimal implementation.
  The only expected difference is slight change in formatting (lack of
  scientific notation).
- datetime `from_ffi_dt` and `as_ffi_dt` functions now public
- `DecodeError` has now better error messages with report of deeply nested values
  and actual MessagePack type is reported at type mismatch.
- `schema::space::generate_space_id` is now public function.

### Fixed

- tests on macos
- Used to panic when implicitly converting a 64-bit integer to a `Decimal`
  inside an arithmetic operation, due to global context contention.
- `network::ReconnClient::with_config` constructor now has `pub` visibility,
  so it's now possible to use it with non-default credentials.
- Bug in legacy `net_box` client which resulted in a deadlock when receiving an
  error during authentication.
- Bug in legacy `net_box` client which resulted in a deadlock when sending
  requests after receiving a previous error response.
- Use after free when calling `BoxError::error_type` in some cases.
- Bug in `define_str_enum` in `Decode` implementation - the slice reference was not modified
  after decoding.
- `tarantool::set_error` used to do undefined behaviour when the message
  contained formatting sequences of %n sort.
- Used to panic when logging messages which contained nul-bytes.
- Pushing `ViaMsgpack` didn't work in release mode.
- Enums defined with `define_str_enum!` can now deserialize from owned `String`.
  Could be seen when deserializing from `rmpv::Value::String`.
- Stored procedures defined with `#[tarantool::proc]` used to fail to compile
  with doc-comments on the function parameters.
- `msgpack::skip_value` now returns error in case there wasn't enough data to
  skip a msgpack value.
- Bug in `Tuple::format` which could result in undefined behaviour (aka use after free).
- `tlua::Push` and `tlua::PushInto` can now be used on non-empty structs and enums
  with default values for constant generics.

### Deprecated

- `network::client::Error` is now a deprecated alias for `network::ClientError`
- `network::protocol::Error` is now a deprecated alias for `network::ProtocolError`
- `network::protocol::ResponseError` is now a deprecated alias for `error::BoxError`
- `error::Encode` is now a deprecated alias for `error::EncodeError`
- `tarantool::set_and_get_error!` macro is deprecated in favor of `BoxError::new`.
- `tarantool::time::Instant::now` is deprecated, now you need to choose between
  `now_fiber` (likely) and `now_accurate`.
- `index::Index::extract_key` is now deprecated because it has a weird interface
  and semantics. You should use `tuple::KeyDef::extract_key` instead.

### Breaking changes

- `BoxError::error_type` now returns a `&str` instead of `String`.
- `network::protocol::Config` struct is now marked as `#[non_exhaustive]`,
  so that we can add fields to it in the future without breaking backwards
  compatibility. Now it should always be constructed like so
  `Config { foo, bar, ..Default::default() }`.
- `network::protocol::codec::encode_auth` now takes an additional `auth_method` parameter.
- `network::protocol::{Config, api::Auth}` & `net_box::options::ConnOptions`,
  now have an additional field `auth_method`.
- `error::{Error, TarantoolErrorCode}` & `network::client::tcp::Error`
  enums are now marked as `#[non_exhaustive]` for future compatibility.
- Removed `network::client::Error::{Tcp, Io, Protocol}` variants as they were
  confusing to work with.
- Removed `impl From<{TcpError, io::Error, ProtocolError}> for network::client::Error`.
- Most of the variants from `network::ProtocolError` were removed, because they
  are duplicated with ones in `tarantool::error::Error`, only the unique ones are left.
- `tarantool::error::Error::Protocol` now contains a `ProtocolError` which is
  no longer wrapped in an `Arc`.
- Methods of `network::protocol::Protocol` now return `tarantool::error::Error`
  instead of `network::ProtocolError`.
- Functions in `network::protocol::codec` now return `tarantool::error::Error`
  instead of `network::ProtocolError`.
- Remove parameter `limit` from method `network::client::AsClient::execute`,
  which was never used correctly.
- Make `network::client::tcp::TcpStream::connect` non blocking and sync.
- `msgpack::encode` no longer returns `Result` as it should not fail.
- Stored procedures defined with `#[tarantool::proc]` no longer compile with some
  error return types. Previously error type required only trait `std::fmt::Display`,
  but now it requires `tarantool::error::IntoBoxError`.
  This means that most error types from third-party crates are no longer supported,
  but `tarantool::error::Error`, `Box<dyn Error>` & even `String` still work.
- `tarantool::set_error!` macro now returns `()` instead of `-1_i32` as it did previously
- `tarantool::tuple::Tuple::decode` does not support partial decoding anymore. Also any methods/functions which use rpm_serde have same effect.
- `tarantool::msgpack::encode::Decode` now requires a lifetime parameter.

### Added (picodata)

- Support for `AuthMethod::Ldap` in `net_box` & `network::client`.
- Support for `AuthMethod::MD5` in `net_box` & `network::client`.
- Expose `box_generate_func_id` to generate function identifiers for reserved
  and default ranges in `_func` space.
- `Tuple::data` method for getting access to tuple data as a slice of bytes.
- `PartialEq`, `serde_bytes::Serialize` implementations for `Tuple`.
- `tuple::TupleBuilder` helper struct for creating `Tuple` instances with a
  special **experimental** rust allocated implementation.
- `TupleFormat::with_rust_allocator` constructor for the special
  **experimental** rust allocated implementation of tuple virtual table.

### Changed (picodata)
- `Tuple::decode` & `ToTupleBuffer` implementation for `Tuple` is now a bit more
  efficient because one redundant tuple data copy is removed.

### Fixed (picodata)

### Breaking changes (picodata)
- SQL module was totally refactored: all its public structures functions and FFIs have
  been changed.

# [4.0.0] Jan 12 2024

### Added

- `impl<E: Into<Error>> From<TransactionError<E>> for Error`.
- `transaction::is_in_transaction`, `transaction::begin`, `transaction::commit`,
  `transaction::rollback` shallow wrappers around corresponding ffi functions.
  These are useful for specific non-trivial cases, but for most users
  `transaction::transcation` is suitable.
- `space::space_id_temporary_min` function for getting minimum space id in the
  fully temporary space id range.
- `msgpack::encode` module which contains custom `Encode`, `Decode` traits
  and correponding derive macros for serialization to/from msgpack without using serde.
- `FiberId` type alias.
- `fiber::id`, `fiber::csw_of`, `fiber::name`, `fiber::name_of`,
  `fiber::name_raw` `fiber::set_name`, `fiber::set_name_of`, `Fiber::id`,
  `Fiber::id_checked`, `fiber::JoinHandle::id`, `fiber::JoinHandle::id_checked`
  functions for getting and setting the corresponding properties of fibers and
  `ffi::has_fiber_id` function for checking if the corresponding api is
  supported in the current tarantool version.
- `fiber::exists` function for checking if fiber with given id exists.
- `fiber::JoinHandle::cancel` for cancelling the fiber by it's join handle.
- `fiber::JoinHandle::wakeup` for waking up the fiber by it's join handle.
- `fiber::cancel` function for cancelling the fiber by id.
- `fiber::wakeup` function for waking up the fiber by id.
- `fiber::Builder::{start_non_joinable, defer_non_joinable}` functions for
  spawning non-joinable fibers. These functions return the fiber id, if the
  corresponding api is supported in your tarantool version. If not, you can use
  `fiber::id`, which works on older versions by using lua api.
- `fiber::Cond::wait_deadline` for waiting until `tarantool::time::Instant`
  rather than a `Duration`. Uses `fiber::clock` internally.
- `fiber::r#async::timeout::{deadline, IntoTimeout::deadline}` for constraining
  futures with an explicit deadline.
- `util::str_eq` function for comparing strings at compile time.
- `define_enum_with_introspection` enum for defining enums with some
  introspection facilities including type-safe conversion from integers and
  `MIN`, `MAX` & `VARIANTS` associated constants. For more details see the
  implementation.
- `define_str_enum` now also uses `define_enum_with_introspection` internally
  so that these enums also have the introspection facilities.
- `Vclock::cmp_ignore_zero` method for comparing vclocks from different replicas.
- `tarantool::proc::Proc::is_public` attribute which returns true if the stored
  procedure defined with `#[tarantool::proc]` has a `pub` visibility modifier or
  has an explicit `(public = true)` attribute. `(public = false)` also works.
- `tarantool::error::Error::variant_name` method for getting name of the error
  variant, because somebody needs this.
- `tarantool::static_assert` macro for adding checks that run at compile time.
- `tuple::KeyDef::{extract_key, extract_key_raw}` methods for extracting index keys
  from tuples.
- `tuple::KeyDef::validate_tuple` method for checking if tuple contains the index key.
- `impl TryFrom<&index::Metadata> for tuple::KeyDef`
- `network::client::tcp::UnsafeSendSyncTcpStream` hack which is necessary to
  work with third-party async libraries.

### Changed

- `define_str_enum` macro now also adds `msgpack::{Encode, Decode}` implementations.
- Fibers created with `fiber::start`, `fiber::defer` and/or `fiber::Builder` are
  now always marked as cancellable. On newer versions of tarantool fibers cannot
  be made non-cancellable, so we explicitly do the same for older versions.
- `tarantool::{c_str, c_ptr}` macros now check at compile time if the provided
  literal contains a nul byte, and therefore they aren't `unsafe` anymore.
- When spawning fibers via the `fiber::Builder` api if the fiber name contains
  a nul-byte an error will be returned instead of panicking.

### Fixed

- `define_str_enum` will no longer produce warning "`&` without an explicit
  lifetime name cannot be used here". For more information, see
  https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/115010.
- `#[tarantool::test]` declares a special static variable which is usually
  invisible to the users, but previously it would have a not so unique name
  which would sometimes lead to name conflicts with user-defined items.
  This has been changed and the conflicts are now less likely to occur.
- Use after free when catching a panic after a drop of a non-joined join handle.
  Memory is now leaked instead.
- `schema::space::create_space`, `Space::create` & `space::Builder::create` will
  no longer yield twice. After recent changes to space id generation we have
  introduced some race conditions when spaces are created concurrently in
  separate fibers. Under heavy load this could result in attempts to create
  spaces with repeating ids. This is now fixed.
- Some tests were broken on tarantool builds from master branch.
- Removed an erroneously added print statement from Vclock::ignore_zero.
- `tlua::error!` macro now expands the format even when no arguments are
  specified. Before this `tlua::error!(lua, "{var}")` would return error
  containing literally the message "{var}", but now it will use the value of
  `var` variable in the current scope.

### Deprecated

- `tarantool::fiber::Fiber` is now deprecated in favour of `fiber::start`,
  `fiber::defer` and/or `fiber::Builder`. This is because old api is among other
  things unsafe as it may result in crashes or even worse. See doc-comments for
  more info.

### Breaking changes

- Remove erroneously added `clap::ArgEnum` implementation for `AuthMethod`.
- Removed deprecated trait `AsTuple`
- Removed deprecated `Tuple` methods `from_struct`, `as_struct` & `into_struct`
- Removed deprecated `FunctionArgs` method `as_struct`
- enums `TarantoolErrorCode`, `IteratorType`, `SayLevel` & `SystemSpace` no
  longer implement trait `ToPrimitive`, just use `as i32` instead.
- `rmp` library reexport is moved from `tuple` module to `msgpack` module.
- `fiber::csw` now returns `u64` instead of `i32`.
- Removed `datetime::Error::ErrorEpochTypeConvert` as it's never used.
- `TarantoolErrorCode` & `SayLevel` no longer implement `num_traits::FromPrimitive`.
- `tlua::error!` macro no longer prepends file:line:column to the error message
  when called with a single string literal. This used to be done as an
  optimization because we could do it for free at compile time, but now the code
  is simpler and the source location was unreliable anyway (didn't take into
  account `#[track_caller]`).
- `space::SPACE_ID_MAX` constant's value is decreased by one and now has the
  same value as in tarantool-3.0. Most likely you shouldn't care about this, but
  in some rare cases we may forbid you from creating a space with id 0x7fff_ffff.
- `error::Error` enum now contains errors from `msgpack::encode` module in `MsgpackEncode`
  and `MsgpackDecode` variants correspondingly.
- `error::Error` enum now contains `Other` variant which can contain an value of
  a type which implements `Error + Send + Sync` traits.
- `index::Part::{collation, path}` builder methods now take a `impl Into<String>`
  instead of `String`. This shouldn't be a problem for you unless you're calling
  them like `Part::path(p.into())`, in which case just remove the `.into()`.
- `index::Index::extract_key` method is now unsafe, because it is unsafe and may
  cause crashes if called with invalid arguments.
- `network::client::tcp::TcpStream` no longer implements `Send` & `Sync` traits,
  because it's not safe to use it outside the thread it was created in.
- Removed `network::client::tcp::TcpStream::close_token` method &
  `network::client::tcp::CloseToken` struct using which would invoke undefined behaviour.

### Added (picodata)

- struct `read_view::ReadView` for opening read views on selected spaces.
- Expose `box_access_check_space` to be able to run access checks on spaces externally
- Expose `box_access_check_ddl` to be able to run more access checks on spaces, users, roles and functions externally.
- ffi logger functions `log_set_format` and `log_default_logger`
- ffi cord (tarantool thread) functions `current_cord_name`, `cord_is_main_dont_create` and `cord_is_main`
- `cbus::sync` module with any thread to cord (TX thread) synchronous channels

### Fixed (picodata)

- A race condition causing undefined behaviour due to fiber_cond_delete being called outside tx sometimes
- A race condition causing unbounded channel receiver too block the thread forever
- A race condition in cbus unbounded channels when two threads write into one LCPipe

### Breaking changes (picodata)

- Changes in the cbus LCPipe api: now `LCPipe::push_message` requires mutable self reference
- `cbus::unbounded::Sender::send` return a `Result` type instead of nothing
- `cbus::Message` now require a `Send` implementation on a callback function

# [3.0.1] Sep 28 2023

### Fixed

- Change tarantool-proc version to fix backwards compatibility

# [3.0.0] Sep 26 2023

### Added

- With the new `async-std` feature flag `network::client::tcp::TcpStream` implements
  async `Read` and `Write` traits from `async-std` crate instead of `futures`.
- `box.session.su` API is now supported. When building for picodata with `picodata` feature enabled this API will use C-API directly. When used with vanilla tarantool lua polyfill is used.
- New `tarantool::session::user_id_by_name` API is available when running `picodata`.
- New `AuthData` generates authentication data when running `picodata` (a wrapper over `box_auth_data_prepare` symbol from the C API).
- Authentication methods enum (`AuthMethod`) was added to the module.
- Method `space::Builder::space_type`, field `SpaceCreateOptions::space_type` and
  enum `SpaceType` which is now the primary way of specify the type of space.
- Fully-temporary spaces can now be created, destroyed and indexes can be created
  for them as well (see `SpaceType::Temporary`). This feature requires your
  tarantool executable to support some low level APIs, you can use the newly
  added `ffi::has_fully_temporary_spaces` function to check if the required
  APIs are supported.
- `SystemSpace::as_space` method for easier conversion to `Space`.
- `schema::space::space_metadata` function
- `space::SPACE_ID_MAX` constant with a value of the maximum possible space id.
- `ViaMsgpack` wrapper type for passing values to/from lua by converting them
  to msgpack first.
- `msgpack::ValueIter::len` method which returns array length if it's known.

### Fixed

- `tarantool::log::say` used to do undefined behaviour when the message
  contained formatting sequences of %n sort.
- performance issues when sending large amounts of data via network::client.

### Changed

- `network::client::tcp::TcpStream` will now always try IPv4 addresses first when connecting.
- `tarantool::session::uid` and `tarantool::session::euid` when running `picodata` now use native C-API instead of calling into Lua.
- Updated some doc comments for Space and Index methods.

### Deprecated

- Methods `temporary`, `is_local` & `is_sync` of struct `space::Builder` are
  deprecated in favour of new method `space_type`.
- `schema::space::SpaceMetadata` is now a deprecated alias of `space::Metadata`.
- network::client::tcp::Error variants ResolveAddress & Connect now contain the
  address for which the corresponding operation has failed.

### Breaking changes

- `tarantool::session::uid` and `tarantool::session::euid` now return `UserId` type which is an alias for `u32`. Previously `isize` was used.
- `SpaceCreateOptions` fields `is_temporary`, `is_local` & `is_sync` are
  removed in favour of new field `space_type`.

# [2.0.0] Aug 28 2023

### Added

- `tarantool::log::TarantoolLogger::convert_level` method for converting
  log::Level to SayLevel taking the mapping function into account.
- `tlua::Push` and `tlua::LuaRead` implementations for `SayLevel`.
- `examples/luaopen` example of how to implement native lua modules.
- `tarantool::cbus` module for communication between any arbitrary thread and
  tarantool thread via syncronization primitives (channels) and low-level cbus api.
- `tarantool::time::Instant` a custom implementation of std-like `Instant` with more saturating operations
  and support of the `fiber_clock` API.
- `r#async::sleep` - an async friendly analog of `fiber::sleep`.
- `SpaceEngineType` variants `SysView`, `Blackhole` and `Service` which cannot
  be created by users, but can be deserialized from contents of \_space system space.
- `fiber::Builder::defer_ffi` & `fiber::Builder::defer_lua` low-level functions.
  Users should use `fiber::Builder::defer` instead in most cases.

### Changed

- `fiber::defer` will now use a more efficient implementation on newer versions
  of tarantool.

### Fixed

- `log::Log::enabled` implementation for TarantoolLogger no longer ignores the
  mapping provided at construction.
- A copy of fiber name used to leak in `Fiber::new` and `Fiber::new_with_attr`.
- `tarantool::decimal` api is now thread safe, which allows it to be used in concurrent threads.

### Deprecated

- `fiber::start_proc`, `fiber::defer_proc`, `fiber::Builder::proc`, `fiber::Builder::proc_async`:
  in favor of `fiber::start`, `fiber::defer`, etc. These used to be implemented with optimizations,
  but now their internals are simplified and unified, so there's now no difference between the
  "proc" and "non-proc" variants. This may result in minor performance degradation in debug builds,
  but in release builds there shouldn't be any difference.
- `fiber::UnitJoinHandle`, `fiber::LuaJoinHandle` & `fiber::LuaUnitJoinHandle`
  are now just aliases to `fiber::JoinHandle` and are deprecated.

### Breaking Changes

- `transaction::start_transaction` has a more flexible error handling,
  and is renamed to `transaction::transaction`
- `fiber::clock` now returns `tarantool::time::Instant`
- `fiber::time` and `fiber::time64` returning non-monotonic time removed. If
  calendar time is needed, use `std::time::SystemTime`.
- `tlua::PushIterError::TooManyValues` now stores how many values were attempted
  to be pushed.
- `<tlua::AsTable as Push>::Err` changed from `PushIterError` to
  `AsTablePushError`.
- `fiber::clock64` removed in favor of a new `Instant` based `fiber::clock` API
- `Error::Decode` now contains expected rust type and actual incorrect msgpack
  contents.
- `sql::Statement::execute` now returns `Error::DecodeRmpValue`.
- Removed a lot of helper structs and traits from `fiber` module, including
  `fiber::LuaFiber`, `fiber::FiberFunc`, etc. Users
  should not have been using those anyway, because `fiber::start`, `fiber::defer`,
  `fiber::Builder::start`, `fiber::Builder::defer` exist.
- Changed return types of function which spawn fibers.
  Now a single `fiber::JoinHandle` type is used everywhere.

  from index metadata. Can be used to compare tuples with a key.
- `IndexMetadata::to_key_def_for_key` method for creating `tuple::KeyDef`
  similar to `to_key_def` but is used for comparing just the keys themselves.
- `IndexId` and `SpaceId` type aliases

### Changed

- `r#async::timeout::Timeout` can now only be wrapped around a future which
  resolves into a `std::result::Result<T, E>` and timeout itself now resolves
  into `r#async::timeout::Result`.
- `LuaRead` methods now return `WrongType` error in case of failure.
- `LuaRead` for `Tuple` now accepts arbitrary lua tables, not only tuples.
- `KeyDef::new` now accepts iterator over references to `KeyDefPart` and returns

  that caused tests failure.

### Removed

- `r#async::timeout::Expired` in favor of `r#async::timeout::Error`

- `space::Field` now implements `From<(S, space::FieldType)>` &
  `From<(S, space::FieldType, IsNullable)>` where `S: Into<String>`, which can
  be used in the `space::Builder::field` and `space::Builder::format` methods.
- `space::IsNullable` helper enum.
- `space::Builder::into_parts` & `index::Builder::into_parts` for accessing
  inner structs.

  runtime.
- `fiber::r#async::timeout::{timeout, IntoTimeout}` utilities for constraining

- `tests/test.sh` script for running tests (`cargo test` can now be used).

### Fixed

- `TupleBuffer` no longer copies data into tarantool's transaction memory pool
  in `TupleBuffer::from_vec_unchecked`, which previously would result in a use
  after free in some cases.
- `impl<_> From<tlua::PushIterError<_>> for tlua::Void` is now more general
  which allows more types to be used in contexts like `tlua::Lua::set`, etc.
- `tests/run_benchmarks.lua` now works again.

### Changed

- `TarantoolError::error_code` now returns a `u32` instead of `TarantoolErrorCode`.
- `TarantoolError`'s `Display` implementation will lookup the error code in lua
  in case it's not found in `TarantoolErrorCode` enum.
- `TarantoolErrorCode::NoSuchFieldName` is renamed
  `TarantoolErrorCode::NoSuchFieldNameInSpace`.
- `TarantoolErrorCode::BootstrapReadonly`'s value changed from 201 to 203.
- `update!` & `upsert!` macros are now more efficient due to the use of
  `update_raw` & `upsert_raw`.
- `SpaceCreateOptions::default` now sets `is_local` & `is_temporary` to `false`.
- `space::SpaceFieldType` is renamed `space::FieldType`.
  And `space::SpaceFieldType` is now a deprecated type alias.
- `index::IndexFieldType` is renamed `index::FieldType`.
  And `index::IndexFieldType` is now a deprecated type alias.

  `RtreeIndexDistanceType` now all
  - implement `Display`,
  - implement `std::convert::AsRef<str>` & `std::convert::Into<String>`,

- `space::Builder::format` now accepts `impl IntoIterator<Item = impl Into<Field>>`.
- `index::Builder::parts` now accepts `impl IntoIterator<Item = impl Into<Part>>`.
- `space::Field` constructors accept `impl Into<String>`.
- `Space`, `Index`, `RemoteSpace` & `RemoteIndex` mutating methods now don't
  require `self` to be borrowed mutably. This is safe, because the only
  mutation those methods do is confined in the tarantool api, which is robust
  with respect to what rust mutability rules are supposed to protect from
  (except for thread safety, which is not supported by any of tarantool apis).
  Relaxing the `&mut self` requirement greatly increases the api's ease of use
  with the only downside of added compile warning of "variable does not need
  to be mutable" which is a small price to pay.
- In `tlua` if a lua error happens during code evaluation the location in the
  rust program where the code was created is now displayed in the error, i.e.
  the location of a call to `Lua::eval`, `Lua::exec`, etc. will be displayed.
- `tlua::Lua::set` function now has 2 generic parameters instead of 3 (not
  including lifetime parameters).

### Deprecated

- `update_ops` & `upsert_ops` methods of `Space` & `Index` are deprecated in
  favour of `update_raw` & `upsert_raw`.

# [0.6.3] Aug 08 2022

### Added

- Tuples can now be used as parameters to functions like `Space::get`,
  `Index::get`, etc. (`impl ToTupleBuffer for Tuple`)
- Tuple fields can now be read as raw bytes (without deserializing) using
  `&tarantool::tuple::RawBytes` (borrowed) or `tarantool::tuple::RawByteBuf`
  (owned)
- Tuples can now be efficiently returned from stored procedures defined with
  `#[proc]` macro attribute. (`impl Return for Tuple`)
- Raw bytes can now be returned from stored procedures defined with `#[proc]`
  macro attribute using `RawBytes` or `RawByteBuf`.
- Stored procedures defined with `#[proc]` macro attribute can now accept
  borrowed arguments. For example `#[proc] fn strlen(s: &str) -> usize
{ s.len() }` now compiles.
- `FunctionArgs::decode` method for efficient decoding of the stored procedure
  arguments.
- `tlua::Lua::eval_with` & `tlua::Lua::exec_with` method for passing parameters
  in place of `...` when evaluating lua code.
- `tlua::Strict` wrapper for reading lua numbers without implicit conversions.
- `tlua::CData` wrapper for reading/writing values as luajit cdata. Can be used
  work with primitve cdata types like numbers and pointers and also user
  defined structs.
- `tlua::AsCData` trait for user defined types which can represented as luajit
  cdata.
- `tlua::CDataOnStack` for working with luajit cdata efficiently within the lua
  stack. Can be used to read the raw cdata bytes or for passing cdata values
  into lua functions.
- Added support for reading/writing `isize` & `usize` in `tlua`.
- `Tuple::new` function for creating tuples from anything that can be converted
  to one.
- `Tuple::decode` method for converting tuple into something that implements
  `DecodeOwned`.
- `tarantool::space::clear_cache` function for clearing the cache in case it was
  invalidated.
- `tarantool::space::Space::meta` method for getting space metadata.
- `tarantool::net_box::Conn::execute` for executing remote sql queries.
- `tarantool::trigger::on_shutdown` function for setting a tarantool on_shutdown
  trigger.
- `tlua::LuaRead`, `tlua::Push` & `tlua::PushInto` derive macros now support
  generic structs & enums.
- `picodata` cfg feature for compatibility with [picodata's tarantool fork].
- `impl From<TupleBuffer> for Vec<u8>`
- `impl From<(u32, FieldType)> for KeyDefItem`

### Fixed

- Load type failure on tarantool 2.9 and later related to missing access to some
  internal symbols
- Rust callbacks of `Option<T>` failing when called from lua without arguments.
- `tlua::LuaRead` implementation for `HashMap<K, V>` no longer ignores
  conversion errors.
- Memory leak in `tarantool::set_error!` macro.
- `LuaRead` failing for some derived types related to enums with optional
  variants.
- `test/tests.sh` now supports custom cargo target directories.

### Changed

- Most tuple accessor methods changed their bounds (used to require
  `serde::Deserialize` now require `tuple::Decode`) e.g. `Tuple::get`,
  `TupleIterator::next`, etc. This coincidentally means that you can read a
  tuple's field into a `Tuple`, but you probably don't want that.
- `tarantool::decimal::Decimal` is now implemented using the
  [dec](https://crates.io/crates/dec) crate instead of tarantool built-in
  decimals (which are based on a patched version of the same decNumber library
  as the dec crate). This means there are minor changes in decimal's behavior
  (e.g. they're printed with scientific notation now, etc.) but nothing major.
- `Decimal::log10` & `Decimal::ln` now return `None` in case of invalid values
  instead of panicking.
- `KeyDef::new` now accepts a generic `impl IntoIterator<Item=impl Into<KeyDefItem>>`

### Deprecated

- `AsTuple` trait is now deprecated. User defined types should instead
  implement the new `tarantool::tuple::Encode` trait. And most of the api
  functions now require the parameters to implement
  `tarantool::tuple::ToTupleBuffer` (implemented for `Encode` types by default).
- `Tuple::from_struct` is deprecated. Use `Tuple::new` instead.
- `Tuple::as_struct` & `Tuple::into_struct` are deprecated. Use `Tuple::decode`
  instead.

# [0.6.2] Jun 09 2022

- `Conn::call_async`& `Conn::eval_async` functions for non-yielding network
  operations
- `Space::find_cached`& `Space::index_cached` functions better performance when
  accessing spaces and indexes
- `injected` & `custom_ret` arguments for `tarantool::proc` attribute macro

  just builtin ones) indexable & callable lua values
- `AsLua::pcall` for calling rust functions in protected mode capturing any
  lua exceptions

### Changed

- join handles returned by `fiber::`{`start`|`defer`}[`_proc`] now have a
  lifetime parameter, which allows non-static fiber functions
- conversions between `Tuple`, `TupleBuffer` and `Vec<u8>` have been reorganized
  and made safer
- reading `Vec<T>` from lua no longer ignores elements that failed to convert to
  `T`
- some `tarantool::tuple` operation signatures have been changed removing
  unnecessary `Result`s, whenever an error cannot actually happen
